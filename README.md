# Decentralized Prediction Market

## Project Description

The Decentralized Prediction Market is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to create and participate in prediction markets for future events. Users can create markets by proposing questions with multiple possible outcomes, place bets on their predicted outcomes using Ether, and earn rewards based on the accuracy of their predictions. The platform operates without intermediaries, ensuring transparency, fairness, and automatic execution of market resolution and reward distribution.

Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, this platform leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless environment where market outcomes are verifiable and payouts are guaranteed through smart contract automation.
